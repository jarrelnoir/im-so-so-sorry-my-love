    <h1>For Haelvin</h1>

    <p>
      Haelvin, I want to sincerely apologize for hurting you and making you upset.
      I know I was wrong, especially for leaving you on read during a moment
      that was meant to feel intimate and meaningful between us.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is no excuse for what I did. I understand that my actions may have
      made you feel unimportant or ignored, and that truly breaks my heart.
      You deserve my attention, respect, and emotional presence.
    </p>

    <p>
      I regret disappointing you, not just this time but whenever I failed to
      be the partner you need. I take full responsibility for my mistakes,
      and I genuinely want to make things right.
    </p>

    <p>
      I care about you deeply, Haelvin. I never want to be the reason you feel hurt.
      I am truly sorry, and I hope you can give me the chance to prove
      through my actions that you matter so much to me.
    </p>

    <div class="signature">
      With all my sincerity,<br>
      Yours
